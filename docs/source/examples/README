These are not by any means *recommended* configurations, merely examples
to help you get started.

The syslog_schema.json is the schema I'm using, loosely based on the CEE/Lumberjack schema
https://fedorahosted.org/lumberjack/
http://cee.mitre.org/

logsnarf-rsyslog.conf presents an rsyslog rulebase, which can be applied to an input, and will output a format that
corresponds to that schema. The feature extraction is done in lognorm.rulebase, and is, as you see, quite basic.
